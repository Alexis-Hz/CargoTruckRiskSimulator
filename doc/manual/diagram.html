                Cargo trust class diagram: The UML diagram is not that rigurous most gets,
                sets where ignored, as well as most constructors. Paramethers are in the
                most part missing, and some relations are not represented fully. This was a compromise to keep
                the diagram as clean and readable as possible. Color coded simply to make it simpler to read.
                Black boxes are services or parts of the code not under my direct influence,
                but the connections to these packages and subsystems are well documented in both
                the diagram and the adjunct Javadoc
