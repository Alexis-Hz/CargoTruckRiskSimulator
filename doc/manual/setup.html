        <h1> Setting up the Cargo Simulator</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The cargo trip simulator has to run on a server, we developed using
            an Apache Tomcat 6.0 server, but the simulator should work on any
            later version as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tomcat server requires a couple of things for the simulator to compile,
            it must have Java installed, we used Java 1.6 for the development, so any
            later version should be fine, and might work with earlier versions of java
            with minor adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
            We included a build ant file to compile all the code, in order to compile
            this way, which is amply recommended you must have Jakarta Ant installed
            in the Tomcat server as well; compiling will be further discussed in
            the setup part
        </p>
        <h2>Compiling and setting up</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on what kind of installation you are going there are some different
            things you will need to do. They all involve running ant scripts,
            just depending on the installation different ant targets should be ran.
        </p>
        <h3>Setting up a Terminal Cargo Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            In order to setup a terminal Cargo Simulator you need to install on a server that has access to the Cargo Database and GIS services.
            The servers we use are on the University of Texas at El Paso network, you should install on a machine connected to
            this network and interface with it via secure shell.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>
                For the purpose of this project a subset of the data used in the original project is hosted locally. This will allow to run the application without requiring any of the GIS Services
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The machine you are going to be using should have both java and jakarta and both installed and in the classpaths.
        </p>
        <p>
            Steps for installation:
            <ul>
                <li>Copy the project folder into a folder that you own and have executing and writing rights to
                <li>Run the "runt" target from the ant build.xml file, this will compile and clean the source code if needed, and run the
                terminal application, for further information about the build.xml and file look here: <a href="ant-build.html">Ant Build File Overview</a>
                <li>You should see the command line input menu, it will show available commands with descriptions.
                For further information about the Terminal application see the javadoc here: <a href="../ui/SimControlTerminal.html"> SimControlTerminal</a>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <h3>Setting up a WebApp Cargo Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            In order to setup the webapp version of the cargo simulator you will require a tomcat server with jsp, java and preferably java installed.
            This server should be in the University of Texas at El Paso network, or in a machine that has access to both the Cargo Database Service and the GIS service
        </p>
        <p>
            You must run the "warit" target from the build.xml ant script. You may do this from any computer that has jakarta ant and the source code or
            from the same location where the Terminal versoin is installed. Or even from Eclipse provided you are running a version with the ant plugin setup
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run the "warit" in any way you find the easier, we advise strongly towards the Eclipse way, since it gives you more flexibility.
                <li>The ant script will, compile if needed, and then create a war file on the root directory of your project, for further information
                about the build.xml and file look here: <a href="ant-build.html">Ant Build File Overview</a>
                <li>Copy the war file to the webapp folder in your Apache Tomcat installation, you may do this from ftp or in any way you see fit
                <li>You may need to restart your Tomcat server, depending on the settings of your installation
                <li>After the restart there should be a new folder called cargo in the webapps folder, this is the cargo webapp
                <li>The index.jsp file should be accesible thorough generally the port 8080 or according to the settings in your Tomcat instalation
                <li>You may now run the simulator from the jsp portal, for further information about the jsp portal you may refer to the java doc here:
                <a href="../ui/ZenTerminal.html"> ZenTerminal</a>
            </ul>
