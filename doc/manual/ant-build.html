        <p>
            The ant build xml file has a set of targets to simplify
            the compiling, management and deployment of the Cargo
            Simulator. We will briefly explain the use of each target here.

        add the compile target for the extra code here
        </p>
        <h2>clean</h2>
        <p>
        Deletes the build directory containing the binaries
        </p>
