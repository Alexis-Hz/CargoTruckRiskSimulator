         <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Now that you have the Cargo Simulator installed as explained in
            <a href="setup.html">Setting up the Cargo Trust Simulator</a>
            you will need to understand the trip pool, especially if you want to create new Scenarios
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of simplicity and portability the different routes are hard coded into the application. It would be trivial to create a local reading of routes, but due to time concerns this feature is left in the future work.
        </p>
        <h1>Current Trips pool Contents</h1>
        <p>
            The current trip pool contains 8 different routes in the following order
            <ul>
                <li>0 through 4 are route0</li>
                <li>5 through 8 are route1 </li>
                <li>8 through 15 are route2 </li>
                <li>15 through 17 are route3 </li>
                <li>17 through 21 are route4 </li>
                <li>21 through 121 are routes 0 through 7 in round robin fashion</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
